# Full Stack API Final Project

## Full Stack Trivia

Udacity is invested in creating bonding experiences for its employees and students. A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game. 

Here's what you can do with the application:

1) Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer. 
2) Delete questions.
3) Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4) Search for questions based on a text query string.
5) Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category. 

Completing this trivia app will give you the ability to structure plan, implement, and test an API - skills essential for enabling your future applications to communicate with others. 

## About the Stack

It is designed with some key functional areas:

### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains a completed Flask and SQLAlchemy server.

### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server.
